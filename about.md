Hi I'm Miroojin! and this is where I document my misadventures with code. I'm a software developer and an open source enthusiast. Most of my code is available on <a href="https://github.com/mb-14">github</a>. I spend most of my time coding, reading books, playing football and listening to the Beatles. In my spare time you can find me devouring a roasted chicken at Subway.
